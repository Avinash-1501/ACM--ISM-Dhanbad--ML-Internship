### Week-1
Week-1 is all about EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), Data Storytelling, Data Visualization on
contemporary dataset(s) and data scraping.

The above work is peroformed on the dataset [udemy_courses](https://github.com/Avinash-1501/ACM--ISM-Dhanbad--ML-Internship/blob/master/Week-1/udemy_courses.csv).

### Week-2
In Week-2 we applied Machine Learning algorithms on Bank Customers data to predict the customers who are eligible for the loan as per the bank's criteria.

 ### Week-3
 
 In Week-3 we Developed a Movie Recommendation System which when viewer watches/views a movie, displays a set of movies as recommendation which have the more odds to be liked by the user. We made 3 such systems:  *1.Simple Recommendation System using Correlation method,  2.Content based Recommendation system using KNN,  3.Using Cosine Similarity*
